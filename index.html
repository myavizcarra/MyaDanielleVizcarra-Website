        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, I'm Mya Danielle Vizcarra. I'm a first year at the University of California Riverside, in hopes of receiving a degree in Psychology. I am currently unsure of what job I want to pursue with this career path, but I'm hoping to gain interest and passion during my time at the University of California Riverside. Interesting enough, I entered UCR as a Economics and Administrative Studies major and later on learned that I had a passion for psychology. This urged me to put efforts into a major change as soon as possible. Career paths I have considered would consist of Case Manager, Advertising Agent, or something along the lines of Human Resources. I dubbed these occupations as ones I would take into consideration because you have to have characteristics that show compassion (being able to show sympathy towards others), empathy (being able to understand and share the feelings of another), as well as, courage (being able to take risks), all of which I think I possess. While I am unsure of what career I would like to pursure, I am open to any beneficial and prevalent opportunity that comes my way.<br><br>

        As for professional experience, I have not have much but I am looking forward to gaining more. I have had one real job as a hostess and a waitress at a local Vietnamese and Thai fusion restaurant, Creasian Wok 'n' Roll. As much as I desired having a job, I was a part of many organizations at school and outside of school, while being a full time student. I later decided that it was in my best interest to focus my energy towards my education and extracirricualrs, as these were vital to my college applications. Although I did not have a "real" job, I used my skills and talents to the best of my ability. I started my very own makeup business, as makeup was something I loved and enjoyed doing on the side. I would promote myself on social media platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter and provide the service myself at my place of residence or I would travel to the client. From this, I gained a lot of respect for myself as a person, student and worker. Being involved in so much, you have to be responsible, accountable, organzied, and most of all, driven. I am a very hard worker and something I take pride in is my determination. I never give up and always out my 110% effort into everything that I do. It takes a lot to be successful in today's world, and I am always up for a challenge. <br><br>

        As clichÃ© as this sounds, nobody is perfect. As much as I believe I have strengths, I also have weaknesses. Though I do have time managment skills, there are times where I find myself overwhelmed. This could be caused by a combination of things such as, work overload, stress or problems in my personal life. At times, I find myself getting overwhelmed, but once I am able to take a step back and realize what is at hand, I am usually able to get the job done. One thing I find important, is the idea of taking things one thing at a time and not thinking too far into the future. This is something I have struggled with, but am working on as a transition into the adult world.
